Subject: RE: Sandbox environment at CGI

Hi.

I don’t know of any generic sandboxes available for self-guided study. In my view, we will want to achieve specific learning objectives, aligned to sales play. 
Which solution area is this for? 
What are the learning outcomes? 
This will help me engage with our architects to see how this might be done.
