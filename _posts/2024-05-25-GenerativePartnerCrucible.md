# Data AI Workloads - Azure OpenAI

## What's new

- Added baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architectures and landing zones 

## Deep links

- [Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat) | This article provides a baseline architecture for building and deploying enterprise chat applications that use Azure OpenAI large language models. The architecture employs Azure Machine Learning (AML) prompt flow to create executable flows that orchestrate the workflow from incoming prompts out to data stores to fetch grounding data for the LLMs, along with any other Python logic required. The executable flow is deployed to an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster behind a managed online endpoint. (Microsoft Learn)
- [OpenAI end-to-end baseline reference implementation - GitHUb](https://github.com/azure-Samples/openai-end-to-end-baseline) | This reference implementation illustrates an approach for authoring and running a chat application in a single region with Azure Machine Learning and OpenAI. (GitHub)
- [Azure OpenAI chat baseline architecture in an Azure landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone) | This article describes the architecture of a generative AI workload that deploys the same baseline chat application but uses resources that are outside the scope of the workload team. (Microsoft Learn)
- [Azure OpenAI chat baseline architecture in an Azure landing zone - GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-openai-chat-baseline-landing-zone) | This application landing zone deployment guide assuming you are using a typical Azure landing zone approach with platform and workload separation (GitHub)
