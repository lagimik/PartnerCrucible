The PartnerCrucible curates a [a set of resources to guide  partners on the SaaS journey](/PartnerCrucible/SaaS). This post aims to frame the journey to SaaS and provide some much needed signal to a noisy field.

## TL;DR

* The specific decisions on the s-curve of business growth for a software or services provider are: when and how to embark on the SaaS journey to transition to cloud capabilities.
* The journey to SaaS is often (mistakenly) described as  "*SaaSifying your software solution*"
* The journey to a SaaS business will affect many areas of the current business and technology practices, some of which have very deep roots.
  

## Why SaaS? S-curve of business growth

Why is the topic of SaaS so difficult to wrangle? Much if that comes down to the *s-curve of business growth*, and more importantly and the strategic points of inflection that create dilemmas.

The cycle of business growth seen in the curve can be broken down as: 
* A - Start
* B - Growth 
* C - Scale
* D - Mature

The decisions at the inflection points will determine if the growth persists, stalls, or declines. The specific decisions on the s-curve of business growth for a software or services provider are: when and how to embark on the SaaS journey to transition to cloud capabilities.

## What SaaS? - More than a technology play

The journey to SaaS is often (mistakenly) described as  "*SaaSifying your software solution*". Certainly there are some key technical milestones on the journey to offering SaaS, but there also some critical business milestones as well. Instead, a point of view that reflects the holistic impact of the journey would be "*SaaSifying your business*".

### Business questions to consider
- How will the per-user subscription model affect your current compensation structure for sales? 
- What will the ability to offer a free-trial do to you sales approach and sales cycle? 
- What will you support model and customer success look like to ensure long term use of the solutions?
- How will you transition the existing customer base to SaaS?

### Technology questions to consider
- What will your accessibility strategy be?
- what will the solution lifecycle model look like for you solution(s)?
- How will you transition from a monolith solution to a cloud-based solution? will you partner through P2P motions to get there?
- How will you achieve both scale and still partition customers to ensure security, privacy, and confidentiality?
- How will you harness solution telemetry to guide the evolution of your solution?

We see that the journey to a SaaS business will affect many areas of the current business and technology practices, some of which have very deep roots. A target model can be useful when trying to chart a course in this case. To that end, we will leverage a marketplace model with cloud service providers (CSP), independent software vendors (ISV), and customers. 

## How SaaS? - A Marketplace Model

The following represent a marketplace model. It is a simplified view to encourage discussion and to get the gears turning: *how might this model be leveraged to address some of the business and technology considerations we listed earlier?*

(Ref: *Marketplace private offer with margin sharing*.)
### Marketplace - More that a "listing"

* economic engine that allows direct and bundled tractions to take place
* P2P discovery


the marketplace allows the service partners to bundle software capabilities, rather than infrastructure, to solve business problems.
Offset the hardware margins with additional customer segments, solving more problems for customers.
Needless to say need to be leveraging platforms with deep partner ecosystems such as Power platform or Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, or Azure.

### Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

Reselling Microsoft, on its own, does not offer many avenues for differentiation. On the other hand, combining ISV offers to solve customer problems is a much higher value proposition that commands significantly higher margins.

### The Independent Software Vendor (ISV)

* IP accelerators, industry focussed, product white space

## Way forward - *Mainstream* path to SaaS

 *Mainstream* partners will leverage a set of SaaS, Marketplace, and ISV Programs to enable their SaaS journey.
