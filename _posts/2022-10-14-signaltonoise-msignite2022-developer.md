## Summary


**Enabling customers to modernize applications with minimal code changes and increased developer velocity:**

  * With Azure App Service and other Azure application platform services, you can innovate more and build more value for your business. Azure application platform service is a fully managed service that enables customers to focus on app innovation rather than managing, configuring, securing, and updating the underlying infrastructure (because Azure does that for you).  
  
  **Low-code web development:**
  * Power Pages is now generally available. Power Pages is an enterprise-grade connectivity platform for organizations to build and launch external self-service websites, allowing them to connect with their customers, partners and communities and share business data, collaborate, and automate business processes with them at scale and securely. 
  
**Improve operational efficiency by automating repetitive processes with Power Platform:**
  * Building on the success of GitHub Copilot, we’re bringing similar capabilities to Power Automate with description to cloud flows. Now, a maker can describe in natural language the flow they want to build and a suggestion of relevant flows is generated. The maker then adds connections to finalize their flow.   

**Streamline low code governance in your organization:**
* Power Platform enables IT to gain visibility and control over applications at scale with Managed Environments, now generally available. Managed Environments is a brand-new capability to streamline and simplify governance at scale. It gives you more control with sharing limits, security and reliability validations, and the ability to customize the maker onboarding experience.  

**Land low code as a critical tool for skilling today’s workforce:**
* Power Platform has empowered millions of people to do more with less and build mission critical apps for their businesses. Now with the new Power Up program, people without development backgrounds can transform their careers through a guided training program and community.
  
**Increasing productivity and quality for hybrid development teams:**
* We are excited to announce the private preview of GitHub Advanced Security, which brings GitHub’s industry-leading, developer-focused security tooling to Azure DevOps. GitHub Advanced Security provides a native application security solution within our development workflow, enabling management of open-source dependencies, custom code, and secrets across the software lifecycle. 
* Azure Deployment Environments, now in public preview, enables teams to quickly spin up application infrastructure needed to run their project in the cloud, while maximizing security, compliance, and cost-efficiency.
* Microsoft Dev Box and Azure Deployment Environments pair together to give developers a complete cloud-powered workflow for any project, that can be fully managed by IT admins.
  
**Drive application innovation and modernization at scale with cloud-native architectures:**
* Today, we are also proud to share the public preview of Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager which allows customers to easily manage fleets of Kubernetes clusters, run multi-cluster workloads and services, and ensure consistent configuration, access, and governance across your Kubernetes environment.
