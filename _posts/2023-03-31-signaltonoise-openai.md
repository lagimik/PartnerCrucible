# Experiential Discovery with Generative AI

To begin exploring what the potential of Azure OpenAI Service could  be for your company and your customers a first step could be be to leverage GitHub Copilot for your selves. As one of the models in the OpenAI Service, Codex provides a great example of how the augmentation with AI can amplify the developer role.

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can help independent software vendors (ISVs) and professional services companies to develop high-quality code faster and easier. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that can suggest code completions, snippets, tests, and documentation based on the context of your code and the best practices of the GitHub community. GitHub Copilot can help you to:

- Save time and effort by generating code for common tasks and scenarios, such as data processing, web development, machine learning, and more.
- Improve your code quality and reliability by following the standards and conventions of the GitHub community, as well as catching errors and bugs before they cause problems.
- Learn new skills and technologies by exploring different ways of solving problems and discovering new frameworks, libraries, and APIs that you may not be familiar with.
- Enhance your creativity and productivity by getting inspired by the suggestions of GitHub Copilot and experimenting with different solutions and approaches.

GitHub Copilot is designed to work with any programming language and any code editor that supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP). You can use GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio Code, GitHub Codespaces, or any other compatible editor. GitHub Copilot is currently in technical preview and you can join the waitlist to get early access. GitHub Copilot is a game-changer for ISVs and professional services companies who want to deliver better software faster and easier.

# Explore Generative AI Patterns

## Retrieve then read
The *retrieve-then-read* pattern is a common approach used in generative AI systems that aim to produce natural language texts based on some input. The basic idea is to first retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of documents, either public (i.e. Wikipedia) or internal corporate documents, and then use a neural network model to read and summarize the retrieved information in a coherent and fluent way. This pattern can be useful for tasks such as question answering, text summarization, dialogue generation, and more.

One of the advantages of the *retrieve-then-read* pattern is that it can leverage both structured and unstructured data sources, and combine factual knowledge with linguistic skills. Another advantage is that it can reduce the computational cost and memory requirements of the generative model, since it only needs to process a subset of the available information. However, some of the challenges of this pattern are how to select the most relevant documents for a given input, how to handle noisy or contradictory information, and how to ensure the consistency and coherence of the generated text.

*Retrieve-then-read* is a common approach to generative AI, where a system first retrieves relevant information from a large corpus of text and then reads and synthesizes it to produce a coherent output. However, this approach has some limitations, such as the need for a high-quality retrieval system, the dependence on the quality and coverage of the corpus, and the difficulty of handling complex or open-ended queries.

A sample implementation of the *retrieve-then-read* pattern can be found here: [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)

## Learn-then-generate

This approach involves training a system on a large corpus of text to learn general linguistic and domain-specific knowledge, and then generating text based on a given input or prompt. This approach can leverage pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3 or BERT, that can generate fluent and diverse text across various domains and tasks. However, this approach also has some challenges, such as the need for large amounts of data and computational resources, the risk of generating inaccurate or biased text, and the lack of interpretability and controllability of the system.

## Plan-then-write

This approach involves creating a high-level plan or outline of the text to be generated, and then writing the text based on the plan. This approach can help structure the text and ensure coherence and cohesion. The plan can be generated using various methods, such as rule-based systems, hierarchical models, or graph-based representations. However, this approach also has some drawbacks, such as the difficulty of generating flexible and creative plans, the complexity of mapping the plan to natural language, and the trade-off between planning quality and efficiency.

# Customer Ideation and Proof of Concepts

In these early stages of Generative AI there is no shortage of opportunity. By the same token, there is to specific set of use-cases that will define success in every case. A more iterative and design driven approach will be required to bring customer from the initial idea to a proof of concept.

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that involves empathy, ideation, prototyping and testing. Some design thinking approaches that can help identify generative AI use-cases are:

Techn

Approach | Description 
:----- | :---------- 
Empathy mapping| This is a technique to understand the needs, pains and goals of the users or stakeholders of a potential solution. It involves creating a visual representation of what the users say, do, think and feel in relation to a problem or opportunity.
How might we (HMW) questions | These are open-ended questions that frame the problem or opportunity in a positive and actionable way. They help to generate ideas for possible solutions that address the users' needs and goals. For example, HMW use generative AI to create personalized learning experiences for students?
Rapid prototyping | This is a technique to quickly create and test low-fidelity versions of potential solutions using simple and inexpensive materials. It helps to validate the assumptions and hypotheses behind the ideas and get feedback from the users or stakeholders. For example, using paper sketches or mockups to demonstrate how generative AI can produce different types of content or data.
Experimentation | This is a technique to test and measure the impact and feasibility of potential solutions using real-world scenarios and data. It helps to evaluate the effectiveness and viability of the ideas and iterate based on the results. For example, using online platforms or tools to generate and deploy generative AI models and collect data on their performance and user satisfaction.
