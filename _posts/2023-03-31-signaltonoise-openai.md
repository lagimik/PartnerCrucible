How to grow a defendable #GenAI start-up in 2023

1. Unless you're one of the few giga-funded super projects out there, choose a vertical
2. Talk to subject matter experts (SMEs) early and keep them in a feedback loop
3. Your vision can be astronomically big, but if you can't distill it into one well-defined use case that SMEs will intuitively "get", you're operating with a handicap
4. Start to gather proprietary data for your chosen use case, your data and your users will become your most valuable assets
5. Start with an existing software/API that fits your use case, gradually work on building your own tools by leveraging your proprietary data and by extending existing tools
6. Get feedback on your prototype early and take it seriously
7. Grow your user base and focus on improving their experience
8. Once you start to feel comfortable, expand your use case or add another one
9. At some point, you'll have found your product-market fit and then it will all be about scaling ("exploiting") your value proposition

tl;dr - start simple, get feedback from potential users early, integrate data gathering into your processes by design, gradually move away from using third party software by leveraging the proprietary data and the domain expertise you've built. Focus on what's working for your users and nurture a community.

I normally don't do posts like this, but maybe someone will find it helpful. All of this is highly subjective, of course. Feel free to add your own points or revise mine.
