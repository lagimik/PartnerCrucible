## finding purpose amidst the digital frenzy
![Signal to Noise](/PartnerCrucible/Library/signaltonoise-title.png)

September in North America has a special energy: a particular blend of cool air, excitement, and maybe even a little fear. This seems like a perfect time to launch a blog.
## Why

The pace of change is relentless and there is an abundance of resources to help navigate these waters. 

**signal:noise** aims to provide expert and practionner points of view to help you distinguish between digital (or cloud) theatre and real impact. 

The aim is to challenge popular opinions and openly highlight uncertainty to ultimately be comfortable at the edge, which is where much of the meaning endeavours are.

## What

From science:

```
signal:noise
sig-nal-to-noise-ra-tio 
['signal too/ta noiz räSHö/räSHé O'] 
NOUN 
- the ratio of the strength of an electrical or other signal carrying information to that of interference, generally expressed in decibels. 
- a measure of how much useful information there is in a system, such as the internet, as a proportion of the entire contents. 
```

## How

**signal:noise** articles will be inspired by the wide range of interactions between the authors and the the Candian technoligy ecosystem. Apologies in advance if you recognize the circumstances described. 

This blog isn't about pointing out errors; it is just as likely to showcase what good looks like. It is more akin to **op-ed** that unpacks the assumptions and mindsets behind the stories and really digging into what it takes to deliver on digital. 

## When

As it happens. 

## Who

I am a Partner Technology Strategist for Microsoft Canada. Although my reflections are triggered by my experiences in the Canadian technology ecosystem, my thoughts are my own.
