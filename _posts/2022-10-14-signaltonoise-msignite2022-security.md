## Summary
  **Do more with less—migrate, optimize, reinvest:**
  * Azure Migration and Modernization Program (AMMP)* now helps you plan and deploy cloud security services as you migrate, including support for *Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel*.
  * Endpoint protection for 50% less: Starting on November 1 and for a limited time, we are excited to give new and existing customers 50% off Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P1 and P2 licenses. This gives organizations looking to modernize their security portfolio the opportunity to move away from legacy anti-virus solutions. This is a first step to an integrated SIEM + XDR solution that improves visibility across identities and endpoints, so they can be more unified and increase SecOps efficiency.

  **Build your security in from the start:**
  * Today, we announced that Microsoft Defender for DevOps and Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) are now available in public preview.
  * With Microsoft Defender for Cloud, our integrated cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP), customers can seamlessly integrate security from development to runtime and accelerate threat protection across multicloud environments.

  **Protect at machine speed**
  * We are excited to introduce the public preview of *automatic attack disruption in Microsoft 365 Defender*, which helps protect organizations at machine speed where it all comes together—in the SOC. Once an attack is detected in the environment, affected assets like compromised identities and endpoints are automatically isolated. This game-changing capability limits lateral movement and reduces the overall impact of an attack, while leaving the SOC team in control of investigating, remediating, and bringing assets back online.

	**Build your trust fabric with flexible and secure access:**
  *  Today, we announce Microsoft Entra Identity Governance, now available in public preview, which helps organizations ensure that the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right time. This release extends our earlier investments to converge identity governance and access management solutions and delivers a comprehensive identity governance product for both on-premises and cloud-based user directories.
*
	**Decrease insider risk and prevent sensitive data from being shared:**
  * Microsoft Purview helps protect sensitive data all along its journey, from data source to point of consumption. Today, we’re thrilled to announce the general availability of Microsoft Purview Information Protection for Adobe Document Cloud, combining the power of native classification and labeling with the power of Acrobat to seamlessly secure PDFs.
  * Also, in public preview, several new data loss prevention capabilities—including granular policy management and contextual evidence for policy matches on endpoint devices—will prevent the unauthorized sharing or transfer of sensitive data.

**Manage securely across platforms and clouds:**
* In April 2022, we announced a plan to launch a series of premium advanced endpoint management solutions to help increase endpoint security, improve user experiences, and reduce total cost of ownership.
* Today, we’re excited to share that our advanced endpoint management plan will launch in March 2023. The suite will include capabilities such as endpoint privilege management, intelligent automation and data insights, remote help, and automated app patching.
* All these capabilities will be integrated into Microsoft Intune, which is now the new name for our expanding family of endpoint management products.
