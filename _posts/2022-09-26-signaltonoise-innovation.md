## TL;DR

* Canadian business investment in research and development (R&D) and technology adoption are well below the OECD average.

* Insiders: Join [Microsoft Ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home) **October 12–14 at 9:00 AM PDT** to help shape the future of tech

## Innovation equilibrium

There is a persistent **innovation inertia** that was recently summarized by Institute for Research on Public Policy:

*"Discussions about Canada’s innovation performance have followed a familiar narrative for decades. We are among the world’s leading countries for educational attainment and we produce science and ideas on pace with advanced economic peers. But our productivity and economic growth have stalled due to weak innovation among Canadian firms. Business investment in research and development (R&D) and technology adoption are well below the OECD average. Our “low innovation equilibrium” is deep and persistent."*

## Some uncomfortable views from the field

* **Innovation stems from the ground up**: you trapped people in a room and manifest innovation. Innovation is fueled by diversity of perspective and creative tension. It does not happen by accident.
* **Innovation can strike anywhere**: the most innovative customer ideas I've heard to date has come from an auditor at the Canada Revenue Agency and Correctional Services Canada.
* **Innovation is messy**: being comfortable with being uncomfortable is a very different mindset than being scared of being scared,
* **Innovation can be stifled by anyone**: Looking for innovation from those who will be able to see it through is not a recipe for success.

A single blog post won't likely change the Canadian innovation tide. But hopefully it can serve as a call to action, that can begin to shape the habits, to create a sustainable fabric of innovation over time.

But to be clear, it starts with action. Yes, I mean you.
