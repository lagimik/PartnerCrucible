This article refreshes a perspective originally published in 2018: [Why your business should care about DevOps](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/en-ca/uncategorized/2018/05/24/why-your-business-should-care-about-devops/)

## More DevOps saavy, less tools

DevOps, or BizDevSecOps, helps reinforce the organization's capability to to deal with business changes in the wake of disruptions. 
It is a compliment to the strategic planning work, providing the approach for organizations to hypothesize, validate assumptions and adjust to changing conditions. 

However, accelerated digital transformation and a global pandemic do not seem to have deterred many organisations from attempting to conduct business-as-usual. On the business end of things: confirmation by fax still occurs. Business teams expect perfect portals without rolling up their sleaves to make them work. And somehow data is still just a byproduct of using an application. From a technology standpoint, many cybersecurity and infrastructure squads still do not have software development skills on their team. 

How can we reconcile these observations in the context of digital economies and platforms as services? This blog will continue to argue that the organizational willingness to experiment and prevailing views of failure warrant a closer look.

## Experimenting towards purpose and value

When this post was first published the World Economic Forum published new digital business models are the principal reason why just over half of the names of companies on the Fortune 500 have disappeared since the year 2000. See [Digital disruption has only just begun](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/digital-disruption-has-only-just-begun/).

Today, The World Economic Forum is committed to helping companies leverage technology to become more agile in the face of disruption, and to fostering digitally-enabled business models. [Digital Economy](https://www.weforum.org/topics/future-of-the-internet/). There is little doubt that the digital enablement of business, and entire industries in well underway.


## Fail fast, fail forward
Somewhere along the way, under the pretext of risk management, *failure* was cast out of the club of viable leadership moments.In fact, factors such as organizational structure, processes, and workplace culture have traditionally reinforced patterns of risk avoidance.

Quite the opposite, DevOps assumes that things will fail and makes it safe to do so early in the cycle. Designing for failure and shifting left are DevOps practices that handle failure gracefully. Indeed, learning to fail forward is a key step in beginning to frame mindsets around failure. DevOps reduces operational risk without sacrificing the vital learning opportunities. This commitment to learning is a key enabler to the success of emerging DevOps teams.

Through Devops organizations can de-risk new customer or citizen interaction modalities, build an advantage through mining online telemetry, differentiate through usability feedback, and strengthen the solutions through unsuccessful builds, failed test cases, and new security vulnerabilities. Devops turns a low-time-to-failure into a competitive advantage.

## Trust in teams

The ability for DevOps teams to deliver from end-to-end and address cross-cutting concerns is what sets them apart. DevOps teams include all the necessary roles in the delivery process: from business leaders to process designers, security experts, quality assurance, as well as the developers and operations roles. 

One of the key benefits of introducing DevOps processes and culture is that it removes the communication barriers between teams and the reliance on any single individual for progress to be made

The moment organizational leadership realizes the impact  DevOps teams can have on the current practices is a key inflection point. There are (at least) two possibilities:
-they be made to navigate existing processes or 
-they will be given the latitude to define new methods.
For this reason, selecting the right initiative, and the right team, as an initial pilot becomes crucial.


## More than a checklist exercise

Teams don’t “do DevOps”, much like they don’t “do Agile”. They adopt an Agile mindset and live DevOps. Organizational commitment to learning is crucial to success. It’s important to remember that:

```
A team cannot do this alone – they need a coach.
This will not be flawless – there will be learning moments.
You must unlearn - skill sets and responsibilities will change.
It is not for every product at first – and not intended for maintenance work.
It is not for everyone - the change can be overwhelming.
```
