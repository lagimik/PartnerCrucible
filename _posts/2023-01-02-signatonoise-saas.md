This post aims to frame the Independent Software Vendor or Service Provider journey to SaaS and provide some much needed signal to a noisy landscape. This post will cover the *Why, What, How* of SaaS. (We leave the *Who and When* up to the reader.)

# TL;DR

* The specific decisions at the current inflection point on the  **s-curve of business growth** for a software or services provider are: *when and how to embark on the SaaS journey to transition to cloud capabilities.*
* The journey to SaaS is often (mistakenly) described as  "*SaaSifying your software solution*". It is, in reality, about "**SaaSifying your business**"
* The journey to a SaaS business will **affect many of the current business and technology practices**, some of which have *very deep roots*.
* Frame your north star in terms of both a target **marketplace and technology model**
* **[SaaS Academy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/saas-academy/main) and [Marketplace Summit](https://marketplacesummit.microsoft.com/)** and key guides on this journey.


# Why SaaS? - The S-curve of business growth

Why is the topic of SaaS so difficult to wrangle? Much if that comes down to the *s-curve of business growth*, and more importantly and the strategic points of inflection that create dilemmas.

![Sigmoid business curve](/PartnerCrucible/Library/sigmoid.jpg)

The cycle of business growth seen in the curve can be broken down as:
* A - Start
* B - Growth
* C - Scale
* D - Mature

Over the life of any business, decisions at the inflection points will determine if the growth persists, stalls, or declines. The specific decisions on the s-curve of business growth for a software or services provider are: *when and how to embark on the SaaS journey to transition to cloud capabilities*.

# What SaaS? - More than a technology play

The journey to SaaS is often (mistakenly) described as  "*SaaSifying your software solution*". Certainly there are some key technical milestones on the journey to offering SaaS, but there also some critical business milestones as well. Instead, a point of view that reflects the holistic impact of the journey would be "*SaaSifying your business*".

## Business questions to consider
- How will the per-user subscription model affect your current compensation structure for sales?
- What will the ability to offer a free-trial do to you sales approach and sales cycle?
- Does the inital lower cost of of SaaS solutions and streamlines sales cycle create new opportunities in different market segments?
- What will you support model and customer success look like to ensure long term use of the solutions?
- How will you transition the existing customer base to SaaS?
- ...

## Technology questions to consider
- What will your accessibility strategy be?
- What will the solution lifecycle model look like for you solution(s)?
- How will you transition from a monolith solution to a cloud-based solution? will you partner through P2P motions to get there?
- How will you achieve both scale and still partition customers to ensure security, privacy, and confidentiality?
- How will you harness solution telemetry to guide the evolution of your solution?
- ...

We see that the journey to a SaaS business will affect many areas of the current business and technology practices, some of which have very deep roots. A target model can be useful when trying to chart a course in this case. To that end, we will leverage a marketplace model with cloud service providers (CSP), independent software vendors (ISV), and customers.

# How SaaS? - A Marketplace Model

The following represent a marketplace model. It is a simplified view to encourage discussion and to get the gears turning: *how might this model be leveraged to address some of the business and technology considerations we listed earlier?*

![Marketplace private offer margin sharing](/PartnerCrucible/Library/marketplaceprivateoffermarginsharing.png)

(Ref: [Activate an ecosystem of partners and unlock new markets](https://ospeventcdn.event.microsoft.com/events/MarketplaceSummit/Decks/Marketplace_Summit_06_Activate%20an%20ecosystem%20of%20partners%20and%20unlock%20new%20markets.pptx?sv=2021-08-06&se=2023-01-03T15%3A46%3A41Z&sr=b&sp=r&sig=c8S0pCQot72puaR8NPjpbE7hzgyFIRVOeUhbTLNBHSE%3D).)

## Marketplace - More that a *"listing"*

A common misconception about the Microsoft Commercial Marketplace is that it is simply a listing of software and service offers. The Commercial Marketplace is much more than that. Here are a few often overlooked aspects of the Commercial Marketplace:

* The Commercial Marketplace allows partners to co-sell with Microsoft an work directly with Microsoft sales teams and Microsoft partners on joint selling opportunities. This can aid with:
    * Expanding your solution portfolio to new markets and segments.
    * Generating new marketing leads and sales opportunities.
* The Commercial Marketplace is a key element in Partner-to-Partner (P2P) opportunities.
* The Commercial Marketplace allows service partners to bundle Independent Software Vendors (ISV) software capabilities as part of their offer to solve business problems.
* Microsoft and customer incentives exist to further reduce the hurdles to transacting through the Commercial Marketplace.



## Marketplace for the Cloud Service Provider (CSP)

Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) are Microsoft partners who are authorized to sell Microsoft Cloud Services under Cloud Solution Provider licensing.

Reselling, on its own, does not offer many avenues for differentiation. On the other hand, combining ISV offers and service provider expertise to solve customer problems is a much more compelling value proposition that commands significantly higher margins. Further surrounding the software with assessments, proof-of-concepts, free-trials, support, and consulting services creates additional revenue acceleration opportunities.

## Marketplace for the Independent Software Vendor (ISV)

An independent software vendor (ISV), also known as a software publisher, is an organization specializing in making and selling software, as opposed to computer hardware.
(source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor)

* Co-selling with Mnicrosoft through Commercial Marketplace allows ISVs to reach Enterprise customers and simplify sales.
* Offers sold through Microsoft are called transactable offers. An offer that is transactable is one in which Microsoft facilitates the exchange of money for a software license on the publisher’s behalf.
* A private offer enables the ISV publisher to provide a margin on their published solution to incentivize you to sell that solution to their customers.
* *Multi-party private offers* (coming to private preview) will empowering the partner ecosystem to sell together while unlocking customer cloud consumption benefits.
