# Welcome

September in North America has a special energy: a particular blend of cool air, excitement, and maybe even a little fear. This seems like a perfect time to launch a blog.

## Why

The pace of change is relentless. The social feeds are overflowing with annoucements, and opinions. While there is a wealth of disparate source that basicallt chronicle, and comment on, how all this is unfolding, most grazes the surface and overlook the need to set the context, or discuss the real-world challenges being addressed. Finding the or the real signal across these disparate points is challenging.

**signal:noise** aims to provide points of view from experts and practionners to help you distinguish between digital (or cloud) theatre and the actions that drive meaningful and durable impact. 

The aim is to challenge popular narrative and openly highlight uncertainty to ultimately be comfortable engaging at the edge, which is where much of the meaning endeavours are.

## What

```
signal:noise
sig-nal-to-noise-ra-tio 
['signal too/ta noiz räSHö/räSHé O'] 
NOUN 
- the ratio of the strength of an electrical or other signal carrying information to that of interference, generally expressed in decibels. 
- a measure of how much useful information there is in a system, such as the internet, as a proportion of the entire contents. 
```

## How

**signal:noise** articles will be inspired by the wide range of interactions between the authors and the the Candian technoligy ecosystem. Apologies in advance if you recognize the circumstances described. 

This blog isn't about pointing out errors; it is just as likely to showcase what good looks like. It is more akin to **op-ed** that unpacks the assumptions and mindsets behind the stories and really digging into what it takes to deliver on digital. 

## When

As it happens. 

## Who

I am a Partner Technology Strategist for Microsoft Canada. Although my reflections, and those of my collborators, are triggered by my experiences in the Canadian technology ecosystem, our thoughts are my own.
