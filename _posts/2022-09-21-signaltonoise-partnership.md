## TL;DR

The **Microsoft Cloud Partner Program (Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program)** links Microsoft and partner business and technical activities. To do this, partners engage with Microsoft in the following ways:

* Through a Microsoft Cloud Partner Program (Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program) membership
* Publishing a go-to-market solution or offer for co-sell via the  **Microsoft Marketplace**
* Achieving Microsoft **Solution Partner Designations** attesting to a standard threshold of expertise and experience
* Completing verified technical **Specialisation** to differentiate themselves in market

The [Practice Enablement Guides](https://aka.ms/enablementguides) are a key resources to guide your learning and certification journey.
In addition, the [PartnerCrucible](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/) hosts a collection of links to key resources for partners.

## The path to partnership

I receive many request from partners asking to guidance on their partnership journey will Microsoft. In most cases, we first need to work towards a common view of what the partnership entails and affords. It is also common for me to reiterate that the ecosystem is a competitive commercial space and they will need to be ready to **get after it**.

The technology landscape is dynamic, and each market, industry, and segment has their own opportunities and challenges. For this reason, there is **no single recipe for success**.

However, there are some **key pillars** that frame partnerships on which more complex scenarios, such as partner to partner, or co-innovation, can then be built. An example of *crawl, walk, run*.

These pillars are described in the [Microsoft Cloud Partner Program Blog Post](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2022/03/16/evolving-microsoft-partner-network-programs-for-partner-growth-and-customer-success/) and summarized with specific actions to take in the **Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program Playbook Below**.
