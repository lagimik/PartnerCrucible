# Partnership in innovation

![Signal to Noise](/PartnerCrucible/Library/signaltonoise-partnershipinnovation.png)

[< Back to Signal:Noise index](/PartnerCrucible/SignaltoNoise)

Previous **Signal:Noise** posts touched on [innovation](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/2022/09/12/signaltonoise-innovation.html) and [partnership](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/2022/09/21/signaltonoise-partnership.html) separately. This post brings both topics together.

## TL;DR

* There are opportunities for joint partnership and innovation across a gradient of approaches ranging from **programmatic partnerships, to innovation  partnerships, to business  partnerships, to strategic partnerships**.
* *Mainstream* partners will engage through programmatic partnership through the Microsoft Cloud Partner Program (MCPP) and  keep abreast of the latest platform developments through public previews.
* *Insiders* will uncover ways to define *innovation, business, or strategic partnerships* by identifying **customer-zero, gives-and-gets, co-innovate, and drive for outcomes**


## Partnership Gradient

![Partnership models](/PartnerCrucible/Library/partnershipmodels.png)

Across the ecosystem partners are innovating to deepen their focus, increase technical intensity, or expand into new technical areas or markets. This can take the form of  pivoting their existing offerings to SaaS, building on the Microsoft Cloud platform, or forming alliances, to name a few. *Table 1* is a non-exhaustive list of partnership approaches taking place across the ecosystem.

### Table 1: Microsoft partnership gradient

## Way forward - *Mainstream* partnership and innovation

 *Mainstream* partners will engage through programmatic partnership through the MCPP and  keep abreast of the latest platform developments through public previews.

Platform |  References
:----- | :----------
Azure | [Public previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?status=inpreview)
O365 | [Public previews](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=Preview)
Dynamics 365 <br> Power Platform  |[Release planner](https://experience.dynamics.com/releaseplans/?app=Power+Apps)

Mainstream partner will bring this innovation to market through [Go-to-Market resources](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-ca/solutions/go-to-market#/) and scale through [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/) or[AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-CA/).


## Way forward - *Insiders* partnership and innovation

In addition to mainstream approaches, *Insiders* will uncover ways to define innovation, business, or strategic partnerships. * A partnership model to consider would be **customer-zero, gives-and-gets, technical executions, and drive for outcomes**


Stage | Description | References
-----: | :---------- | :-----
**Identify Customer-Zero** | Innovation needs to be aligned to, and grounded by, tangible value to a customer. Identifying the first driven customer is the first step.  | [How Microsoft cloud technology and co-innovation approach are driving business value for customers across industry](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/04/26/how-microsoft-cloud-technology-and-co-innovation-approach-are-driving-business-value-for-customers-across-industry/)
**Define Gives-and-Gets** | At this stage, the gives-and-gets aren't financial in nature. Consider *joint press releases, co-marketing investments, Azure credits, trial licenses, access to Microsoft experts, and partner and customer feedback and telemetry*. These elements often constitute these agreements Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) | Confidential
**Co-innovate** |  A few existing structured engagement paths are described in the references and be helpful in opening doors ---> <br> <br>Leverage the gives-and-gets to **get after it**.| - *Private previews* are normally extended to customers and to their trusted partner. <br> - [Microsoft for Startups](https://startups.microsoft.com/): Open to anyone with an idea - Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub brings together the technology, guidance, and support you need to hit your next milestone. <br> - [The Garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/): The Garage is a program that drives a culture of innovation <br> - [Microsoft AI & IoT Insider Labs](https://aiotlabs.microsoft.com/p/apply): The Microsoft AI & IoT Insider Labs works with companies' technical teams to remove technical roadblocks they face on AI or IoT projects. <br> - [Mixed Reality Partner Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/hololens/mrpp): The Mixed Reality Partner Program (MRPP) is a Microsoft-sponsored, community-driven program for partners that design, build, deploy, and operate mixed reality solutions. <br> - [MISA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/intelligent-security-association#MorefromMISA): The Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) is an ecosystem of independent software vendors (ISV) and managed security service providers (MSSP) that have integrated their solutions with Microsoftâ€™s security technology to better defend against a world of increasing threats.
**Drive Outcomes** | Build on the success of customer-zero by scaling through co-sell in addition to marketplace economics | - [Co-sell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/co-sell-overview): Co-selling is any collaborative engagement between Microsoft and its partner ecosystem. <br> - [Leverage the Ecosystem (Partner to Partner - P2P)](https://msuspartners.eventbuilder.com/P2Pchannelreadiness):  Partners who adopt an ecosystem business model will grow 50% faster over the next two years than partners who do not.

# Get after it

The [PartnerCrucible](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/) hosts a collection of links to key resources for partners. This project aims to serve as an *entry point* into the wealth of information and services available to Canadian Microsoft partners.
