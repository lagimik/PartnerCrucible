previous posts touched on [innovation](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/2022/09/12/signaltonoise-innovation.html) and [partnership](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/2022/09/21/signaltonoise-partnership.html). This post brings both topics together. 


## TL;DR
* There are opportunities to innovation across a spectrum from MCPP, to Joint Ventures.
* *Mainstream* partners will want to keep abreast of the latest platform developments through public previews. 
* *Insiders* will want to define **customer-zero, gives-and-gets, technical executions, and drive for outcomes**



## Partnership Spectrum
