## Summary

**Empower people and automate processes with Microsoft Syntex:**
* We’re excited to introduce Microsoft Syntex: Content AI integrated in the flow of work. It integrates innovations across the Microsoft Cloud, from Microsoft 365 to Azure, to Power Platform, and Microsoft Purview. Syntex automatically reads, tags, and indexes high volumes of content and connects it where it’s needed in context—in search, in applications, and as reusable knowledge. It also manages your content throughout its lifecycle with AI powered security and compliance, backup and restore, and tiered archive storage. Critically, Syntex puts people at the center, with content integrated into collaboration and workflows like eSignature.

**Quickly and easily embed AI into business apps with Azure Applied AI and Cognitive Services:**
* Azure OpenAI Service, available in limited access preview, now offers access to DALL·E 2. DALL·E 2 can create original images from a natural language description, helping organizations enhance brainstorming, develop, and refine visual assets, quickly respond to marketing opportunities, and personalize customer experiences.

**Build and deploy responsible ML models faster to enhance productivity at any scale with Azure Machine Learning:**
* To enhance collaboration, we’re introducing registries that enable teams to share machine learning artifacts at the tenant and organization level for greater repeatability and scale.
* To help customers do more with less, we’ve also consolidated open-source tools within the Responsible AI dashboard, now generally available, for easier debugging directly within a data scientist’s workflow.

**Delivering more time and value through data-driven experiences:**
* Azure Cosmos DB is expanding beyond NoSQL to support distributed PostgreSQL, bringing everything developers love about PostgreSQL to AzureCosmos DB.
* General availability of the SAP Change Capture Data Connector in Azure Data Factory enables customers to bring in SAP data for advanced analytics.
* Azure Synapse Analytics now offers one-click access to Microsoft Graph Data Connect, enabling users to copy select Microsoft 365 datasets into Azure and unlock collaboration and productivity insights. Microsoft Purview combines unified data governance with risk and compliance solutions.
* Business workflows, now generally available, and business metamodels, now in preview, make it easier to maximize the business value of your data and drive cross-functional data governance.
* A new Partner Ecosystem enables ISVs to build on top of the open and governed Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform—delivering an enriched, cost-optimized experience for customers across all industries.
