- [Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat): This article provides a baseline architecture for building and deploying enterprise chat applications that use Azure OpenAI large language models. The architecture employs Azure Machine Learning (AML) prompt flow to create executable flows that orchestrate the workflow from incoming prompts out to data stores to fetch grounding data for the LLMs, along with any other Python logic required. The executable flow is deployed to an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster behind a managed online endpoint. (Microsoft Learn)
