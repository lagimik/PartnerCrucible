# Data AI Solution Area## What's new- Added OpenAI end-to-end baseline reference implementation: This reference implementation illustrates an approach for authoring and running a chat application in a single region with Azure Machine Learning and OpenAI. [GitHub](https://github.com/azure-Samples/openai-end-to-end-baseline)- Added Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture: This article provides a baseline architecture for building and deploying enterprise chat applications that use Azure OpenAI large language models. The architecture employs Azure Machine Learning (AML) prompt flow to create executable flows that orchestrate the workflow from incoming prompts out to data stores to fetch grounding data for the LLMs, along with any other Python logic required. The executable flow is deployed to an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster behind a managed online endpoint. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat)- Added Building your own copilot – yes, but how? (Part 1 of 2): This blog post provides an overview of some of the main choices in the Microsoft technology ecosystem for building your own copilot. Part 1 focuses on low-code tools and out-of-the-box features.
