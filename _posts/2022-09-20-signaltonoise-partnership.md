## TL;DR

I get many request from partners on starting the partnership journey will Microsoft. In most cases, there isn't a common view of what the partnership entails or affords. 

The partnership connects Microsoft and partner  business and technical activities. To do this, partners engage with Microsoft in the following manner: 

* Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) membership
* A go-to-market solution or offer for co-sell with Microsoft via the Marketplace
* Microsoft Solution partner designations as a minimum threshold of expertise and experience
* Verified technical specialisation for differentiation in market
