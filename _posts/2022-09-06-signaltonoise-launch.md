# Welcome to a Microsoft partner *insider view*

In North America, September has a special energy: a particular blend of cool air, excitement, and maybe even a little fear. This seems like a perfect time to launch a blog.

## Why

The pace of change is relentless. Your social feeds are probably are overflowing with announcements, and opinions. There are a number sources, many of them excellent, that chronicle (or comment on) how all this is unfolding. However, identifying meaning paths forward , or finding real signal across these disparate points, is challenging.

**signal:noise** aims to provide points of view from experts and practitioners to help you identify the paths that carry the most signal and can accelerate your digital (or cloud) ambitions. In doing so, it may challenge popular narratives, openly highlight uncertainty, and test your comfort levels engaging at the edge, which is where much of the meaning endeavors are.

## What

```
signal:noise
sig-nal-to-noise-ra-tio 
['signal too/ta noiz räSHö/räSHé O'] 
NOUN 
- the ratio of the strength of an electrical or other signal carrying information to that of interference, generally expressed in decibels. 
- a measure of how much useful information there is in a system, such as the internet, as a proportion of the entire contents. 
```

## How

**signal:noise** articles will be inspired by the wide range of interactions between the authors and the the Canadian technology ecosystem. Some inspiring, and some highlighting real challenges. (Apologies in advance if you recognize the circumstances described.)

This blog isn't about pointing out errors; but will ensure we learn as much from them as we can. At the same time, **signal:noise** will also showcase what good looks like. The blog is akin to an **insider release** that points to key resources, unpacks the assumptions and mindsets, leans into what it takes to deliver through the changes. 


## When

Articles will be published as inspiration strikes, or subject to pull requests. Which ever comes first.  

## Who

I am a Partner Technology Strategist for Microsoft Canada. Although my reflections, and those of my collaborators, are triggered by my experiences in the Canadian technology ecosystem, our thoughts are our own. 

## Way forward

**signal:noise** will  present (at least) 2 paths forward: 
- Mainstream - more noise
- Insiders - more signal

In the coming releases I will be sharing the signal from:

- [Cloud for Sustainability](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/sustainability/2022/06/01/accelerate-your-journey-to-net-zero-with-microsoft-cloud-for-sustainability/)
- [Microsoft Ignite (Oct 12-14)](https://ignite.microsoft.com/)
- [Microsoft ALT Tech Innovations](https://innovation.microsoft.com/en-us/developer)
- And any other aspects inspired by the ecosystem.

### Mainstream

The general, all inclusive approach includes [Partner.microsoft.com - Partners make more possible](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/), although it can be challenging to sift through.

### Insiders

As a first insider's view, I'd invite you to explore [PartnerCrucible](https://lagimik.github.io/PartnerCrucible/). This project aims to serve as an entry point into the wealth of information and services available to Canadian Microsoft partners. The Partner Crucible will curate links, models, and insights to ensure our partners have an overview and a quick path forward.
