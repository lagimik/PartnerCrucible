	Partner Support FAQ
	
		Q. If the customer in on an EA, can a partner request support on behalf of the customer through ASfP? 
			i. Yes.  The partner would have to “request a relationship” and have the proper affiliation with the customer because they likely did not purchase under CSP if they have an EA.   
					Nearly 100% of the time, because the ASfP tickets are “unlimited” and the EA may come with a limit or have a customer cost associated with them, the partner will encourage the EA customer to put the ticket through them (the partner).  
		Q. When should a partner use is support contract versus customer contract? 
			A:   It depends on the scenario. 
				□ A partner should always want to use “their support plan” versus the customers when it is ASfP or PSfP. 
				□ If/When the customer has an EA or their own “Unified/Premier” support, except that the customer would have hours or incidents decremented from their plan and the customer may not want their time/incidents deducted from their support plan.  
				□ ASfP has “unlimited incidents, however, PSfP may also have incidents/time deducted (again, depends on the type of plan the partner has - - i.e. ASfP has unlimited tickets). 
		 
		Q. Can the end-customer engage with Microsoft support using the partner’s entitlement? 
			A. No. The contract is between Microsoft and the partner, not Microsoft and the partner and their hundreds of customers!
