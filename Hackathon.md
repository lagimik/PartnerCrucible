# Hackathons

[< Back to Crucible](./)

## Purpose

Hackthons are developer-focused engagement that connects development teams (Open) with experts to tackle a series of real-world challenges through hands-on experimentation (Hack) in person or online (Virtual).

OpenHack provides a unique and fun upskilling experience for Microsoft employees, customers and partners. Participants work together in teams to complete challenges that increase in complexity and are actively engaged, requiring deep collaboration, as they learn together.

To contribute to the PartnerCrucible, see [Contributor's Guide](ContributorsGuide).
